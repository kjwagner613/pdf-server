<p class="note">When incentives replace purpose, the system still _looks_ legitimate**

This is the part that feels like “decay.”

The outward form remains:

- courts still issue indictments
- agencies still publish rules
- corporations still claim to serve users
- pharma still claims to serve patients

But internally, the logic has inverted:

**The system’s needs come first.  
The people’s needs become incidental.**

Incidental - def:</p>

“Incidental” is exactly the right word here, and it carries a very particular shade of meaning that
fits what you’re describing.
Here’s a clean, precise definition you can use:
Incidental — definition
Something is incidental when it occurs as a minor consequence of something else, not
as the main purpose or focus.
It’s secondary, peripheral, or accidental — not central to the system’s intent.

**3. When incentives replace purpose, the system still _looks_ legitimate**
This is the part that feels like “decay.”
The outward form remains:
- courts still issue indictments
- agencies still publish rules
- corporations still claim to serve users
- pharma still claims to serve patients
But internally, the logic has inverted:
**The system’s needs come first.  
The people’s needs become incidental.**
Incidental - def: Occurring or likely to occur as an unpredictable or minor
consequence: synonym: accidental
The institution's original missions, its purpose to exist, if it serves it at
all, becomes accidental.
**4. The Constitution doesn’t protect against incentive drift**
It protects against:
- tyranny
- concentrated power
- government overreach
But it does **not** protect against:
- bureaucratic expansion
- corporate capture
- institutional inertia
- self-reinforcing incentive loops
Those are modern phenomena. Modernity has redefined tyranny.
The founders built a system to prevent kings.  
They didn’t anticipate **self-optimizing institutions**.
**5. The “spirit” is the same across domains**

The justice system, Google, big pharma — they don’t share a mission, but they
share a **failure mode**:
- They drift from purpose.
- They become self-referential.
- They optimize for internal metrics.
- They lose sight of the human they were built to serve.
- They redefine our common language when it does not serve them anymore
- Then redefine it AGAIN as they shed accountability. Case in point: I am
responsible for the outcome of my existence, what i create is an extension of me.
But institutions can route responsibility through a process they designed — and then blame the process.
Accountability dissolves.

Different symptoms, same underlying mechanism.</p>
